h2. Caboodle was a quick and easy way to create a mashup website, and is kept here for reference.

Sadly, so much has moved underneath Caboodle that it's in need of a refactor. I've moved over to Padrino and much of Caboodle now lives on but as helpers for that framework. At some point I will pull them out into a future version.

What a Caboodle-based site looks like out of the box:
